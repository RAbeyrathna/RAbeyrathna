### [PokéTrails](https://github.com/poketrails)

PokéTrails is a full-stack web game developed for the final Coder Academy group assignment, consisting of myself and 2 other students.

It allows users to hatch, train, and care for Pokémon, as well as send them on trails to find items and earn money.
